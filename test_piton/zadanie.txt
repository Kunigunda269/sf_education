[Python developer for AI](https://www.notion.so/Python-developer-for-AI-1a7203040a3580ecbf15d1753c537762?pvs=21) 

## What to build

1. **Stateless chat graph** — the bot replies to each user message.
2. **Agent using tool** `get_current_time` that the LLM calls when the user asks for the time. E.g:
    
    ```python
    def get_current_time() -> dict:
        """Return the current UTC time in ISO‑8601 format.
        Example → {"utc": "2025‑05‑21T06:42:00Z"}"""
    
    ```
    
3. **Launch** with `langgraph dev`.
4. **Minimal repo** — a single Python file, `requirements.txt`, and a short README.

### Constraints

- Any model is fine (GPT, Gemini, DeepSeek, Ollama with local models, …).
- If you depend on **Ollama** or other local runners, include exact setup commands (`ollama pull …`, default port, etc.).
- No memory or databases. Exactly **one** tool (`get_current_time`).
- Hard time‑box: up to 90  minutes — push whatever runs.

### How we’ll run it

```bash
git clone <your_repo>
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
langgraph dev
```

If during multi-turn conversation asking **“What time is it?”** triggers the tool and returns the correct time, you pass 🌝 and we can proceed to the next part (interview).
